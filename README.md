MerMEId
=======

[MerMEId is a system](trunk/README.md) for the editing, handling, and (pre-)viewing of music
metadata, based on the the [Music Encoding
Initiative](http://www.music-encoding.org/) (MEI)  XML schema. 
As of March 2019 MerMEId supports MEI 4.0.0.

MerMEId is developed at the [Danish Centre for Music Editing](http://www.kb.dk/en/nb/dcm/index.html) (DCM) both for
the production of thematic catalogues of works and for organizing source- and
work-related information during the preparation of scholarly editions of
music.

MerMEId is used for the creation and maintenance of 

* [Catalogue of Carl Nielsen's Works, CNW](http://www.kb.dk/dcm/cnw.html),
* [Johann Adolph Scheibe. A Catalogue of His Works](http://www.kb.dk/dcm/schw.html)
* [J.P.E. Hartmann. A Thematic-Bibliographic Catalogue of His Works](http://www.kb.dk/dcm/hartw.html), and
* [Niels W. Gade. Thematic-Bibliographic Catalogue of His Works](http://www.kb.dk/dcm/nwgw.html)

The services mentioned are delivered using [DCM Catalog UI](https://github.com/Det-Kongelige-Bibliotek/dcm_catalog_ui)

Try MerMEId at the [demo](http://labs.kb.dk/editor/) website. [Important changes](https://github.com/Det-Kongelige-Bibliotek/MerMEId/wiki) are described in the Wiki.
